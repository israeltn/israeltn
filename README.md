👋 Hey there! I'm a passionate software engineer with a strong focus on Security. My journey in the world of coding began with a curiosity-driven exploration of JavaScript, which eventually led me to master frameworks like Angular, Vue, and React. I believe in crafting seamless user experiences with a touch of elegance, and I achieve that using my expertise in Tailwind for creating stunning UIs.

🌐 On the backend, I'm well-versed in Python, PHP, and Laravel. Building robust and efficient systems is my forte, and I love architecting applications that stand the test of time. Whether it's crafting APIs or optimizing database queries, I always strive for excellence in code.

🛡️ As a cybersecurity enthusiast, I possess a deep understanding of Routing, Switching, VLANs, DHCP, and ACLs penetration testing, Cloud computing, web application, and incident response. My hands-on experience in API, Wired and Wireless Network communication ensures confidentiality, integrity and availability. I take pride in my high-level expertise in both Network and Application Security. Protecting digital landscapes is more than a skill—it's a commitment I uphold rigorously.

🔒 Beyond the code, I'm dedicated to building secure and scalable systems. My holistic approach to security extends from the network to the application layers. I understand that the digital world is built on trust, and I'm passionate about fortifying that trust through robust security practices.

💞️  My journey doesn't stop at development – I'm also deeply committed to network and cybersecurity. With high-level expertise in these areas, I prioritize the security of every application I build. From implementing best practices to safeguarding against potential threats, I ensure that the solutions I create are functional and secure.

🌟 If you're looking for a developer who can handle the full spectrum of the development process, from ideation to deployment, all while keeping security at the forefront, I'm your person! Feel free to reach out, and let's collaborate to turn your ideas into reality.
